This project focuses on developing an image-to-text conversion system utilizing the Tesseract OCR engine. By preprocessing images to enhance text recognition, the system can extract textual information from various image formats. The project involves uploading images, applying grayscale and thresholding techniques, and using Tesseract to perform OCR. It is designed to handle different types of images, highlighting the differences in output when processing text-based images versus non-text images. This system is implemented in Google Colab, providing an accessible environment for experimentation and refinement.
